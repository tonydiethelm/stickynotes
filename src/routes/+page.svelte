This is the basic page for the sticky notes application. 
This needs:
    An input text bar for which set of sticky notes the user wants to load. 
    A button with a plus sign to add a new sticky note
    

--------------------------------------------
                |input|                  [+]


        -----------
           notes
          blah
        -----------       ---------
                            other
                           notes
                          ---------


--------------------------------------------



When the user writes in a name in the input bar...
    hit the DB (via the BE) for a set of sticky notes with that name. 
    It should deliver an object that is a set of sticky note objects.
    Go through the object and render each sticky note object to the screen in the appropriate location.

When the user hits the plus button, create a new sticky note on the screen. 


When the user clicks on a sticky note, they can write on it. 

When the user clicks and holds ona sticky note, they can drag it. 

How to delete?
    Highlight the sticky note (or multiple notes) and press Delete
